Live Calendar V 2.0, Sep 2018.
Live Calendar (LC) is a spreadsheet with a few simple Macros designed to serve as a Focus-Mode calendar, where you focus on finishing the current task from your to do list, while keeping your entire day in perspective. To keep you focused it will show the current time, along with a tracker next to task scheduled for right now.
The to-do section of the LC is divided into 20 minute increments. (If you’re familiar with the Pomodoro technique, the calendar is based on 20 minute Pomodori, where you would work 3-4 20 minute increments 60-90 minutes and then tale one Pomodoro break. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
The default time intervals (Pomodoro timer duration) can be easily changed from the current 20 minutes to 25 or 30 minutes based on preference. 
In any case, using LC is simple. Design your (work) day in blocks of 20 minute time slots. Preferably, your day is designed the night before, or as the last thing before leaving work. You can always edit and move things around just as simply as you would in a regular spreadsheet.

When you start your day press the StartTime button, and LC will show you the time as well as color-code a tracker square to the right of your current to do task.

•	Using LC, you can see your entire day (big picture) while staying focused on the task at hand.
•	LC is also a regular spreadsheet. Create a new one every day and it will keep an archive of each day’s time log, achievements, notes, etc.
•	Save it in DropBox and it will be automatically version controlled, and can be rolled back if need be
•	You can edit anything in LC even while it is running. You can take notes, save, move things around and so on.
